                                 <p><b>What types of infrastructure may be funded under this sub-component?</b></p>
                                 <p>• The Scheme envisages providing support to a wide variety of sports infrastructure 
                                    projects, both Greenfield and Brownfield projects, provided they aim at bridging critical gaps in 
                                    sports infrastructure to meet existing demands. Accordingly, all applications will have to include 
                                    an action plan clearly demonstrating how participation, especially community participation will 
                                    be increased through the proposed project(s).
                                 </p>
                                 <p>• Projects will also be judged on the basis of their potential for inclusivity by encouraging 
                                    participation of females, persons with disabilities, etc., potential for multi-use through the 
                                    Universal Design principle, opportunities for collaboration with various stakeholders, including 
                                    educational institutions, community groups and sports bodies, as well as environmental 
                                    sustainability and

                                 <p>• Areas which have experienced natural disasters, such as flood and drought, and with 
                                    strong demand for sports facilities due to popularity of one or more sports disciplines or strong 
                                    population growth or significant change in circumstances (e.g. economic challenges) will be 
                                    given priority.

                                 <p>• Individual component(s) of larger sports facilities, such as stadia, sports complexes, etc., 
                                    will be eligible for funding provided the proposed component(s)meet the assessment criteria of 
                                    this Scheme.
                                 </p>

                                    institutions will be eligible subject to a MoU between the Department of Sports of the

                                 <p>• Project management fees of up to 5 per cent of the total project cost may also be allowed 
                                    per project.
